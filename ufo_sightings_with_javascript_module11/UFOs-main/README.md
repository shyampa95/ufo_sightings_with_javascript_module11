# UFOs

## Project Overview
In this examination, we start our JavaScript exploration by examining the language's technical features and how they relate to data analytics and visualisation.
Typically, JavaScript is thought of as a front-end development language. This indicates that it enhances the user experience by adding more features and customizations.
Our main goal is to create a dynamic website that responds to user interaction.
By incorporating a JavaSript into an HTML page with CSS and Bootstrap and using some Devtools to test our code as we go, we create a dynamic website.
To arrange the UFO data that is kept in a JavaScript array, or list, we first create a table. The major coding language used to develop this table will be JavaScript, and it will have the ability to filter data based on specific criteria.

We use basic HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to build and style the entire page. 
The project is done as follows: 
   - Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
   - A written report on the UFO analysis 


## Resources
Software: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [JavaScript ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp)

## Results
We offer a dynamic portal that enables visitors to simultaneously filter UFO reports based on a number of different parameters. Date, city, state, nation, and shape criteria were available for the table.
Each sighting would be collected into a neat bundle and made available to Dana (and her readers).
The produced table is large and has hundreds of rows, making it impossible for one person to adequately look over and study even though it is nicely arranged.
Therefore, this option is available for group or individual search utilising the filter feature and allows the user to examine, for example, all data connected to May 1 in the US country as follows:

## Summary
Nowadays, dynamic websites make up the majority of the websites we visit. These dynamic websites employ databases to dynamically generate webpage content on the server, which is subsequently transmitted to the user's browser.
The benefit of this is that each user receives personalised content that is unique to them and different from what would be provided to other users.
A static website, in contrast, typically consists of static material (mainly utilising only HTML & CSS) that is already there as complete files on the server. As a result, the content of any webpage that a user requests from this server will always be the same.
